THE EASY STEPS

Firstly, take a saucepan and pour the water and packs of MAGGI tastemaker and switch on the gas flame.
Mix it well and let the water come to a boil.
Now break the pack of MAGGI Masala Noodles and mix well.
Boil for 2 mins on medium flame until it softens.
Now add the corn flour and mix well. (Corn flour helps to give a crunchy base.)
Cook it for 1 more min and switch off the flame.
Then, switch on the flame and place a non-stick pan on it and spread butter on it.
Spread the cooked MAGGI Masala Noodles on it uniformly forming the pizza base.
Cover it and simmer for 5 mins. Make sure to keep the flame on low else the base will burn.
Cook until the base turns crisp.
Turn off the flame and flip it over gently and place it on the pan. (i.e. now the cooked side will be on the upper side of the pan).
Now spread the pizza sauce all over the base.
Now, grate the cheese cube all over the base evenly or if you are using the mozzarella cheese just spread it over the pizza.
Now top it up with diced capsicum, tomato slice and olives.
Now sprinkle mixed herbs, chilli flakes and sweet corn over it.
To make it more cheesy add some more 1 tablespoon cheese on top of it.
Switch on the flame, keep the pan on the gas.
Now spread oil on the sides of the base.
Now cover and simmer for 5 mins on low flame or until the cheese melts completely.
And your Cheesy MAGGI Pizza is ready to be served. Slice the pizza and serve it hot.
